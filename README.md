## My process

This is the process on how i made my solution for the challenge:

1. I set the basic structures of the website using html like the Card of the wesbite and the images and the texts.

2. Then, after setting up all the basic structures of the website i then styled them one by one like how i set the background of the body to very dark blue, and then set the background of the div element with the .card class to not so very dark blue.

3. After setting up all the basic styles for the website to look better, i then lastly set the styles for when a user hovers on a interactive element like the button with the equilibrium immage on it and when a user hovers on it, somtheing like aqua-colored layer will overlay on it with a view icon on its center. I also set the item name and the creator's name so that when a user hovers on it, it will change it's color into aqua.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Working on this project made me learned that i still have so many things to learn like how to maximize my working efficiency and how to organize my codes so that it will be more understandable and so that i could find the codes that i want to find if i ever needed to change some line of code or add something.

this lines of codes are the ones i kinda find cool:

```HTML
<span>HTML line of code that i find cool</span>

- i find <span> element kinda cool cause it has a lot of function and it works like the <div> element that you can put many HTML. 
```
```CSS
- css properties that I find cool 
.css-property::before {
  content: '';
}
.css-property::after {
  content: '';
}

- I find this two css properties cool cause it can give another layer of style in one css class or one HTML element.
```

### Continued development

- Working on this project made me realize that css properties like (css-property::before & css-property::after) is very useful like so that you could set another set of styles on a specific HTML element when you hover on an element or when you click on an element and i want to do more projects like this one so that i could familiarize myself with this kind of css property. I also want to add to my #Continued Development the language that i am currenly learning right now which is JavaScript, as i seen a lot on the internet that if you want to do FrontEnd then learn the three Musketeers of web dev which is HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Right now,  i am still learning the basics of JavaScript as i just started studying it for about 2 weeks now but i'm getting excited as to what i could do after learning JavaScript. Anyway, i think this README.md is getting a little long so im going to end this here now, if you read my README.md which is this, thank you very much and if  you have any advice for me please don't hesitate to comment it on the challenge solution i posted cause it will definitely be of tremendous help for someone as me who is a Self-Taught Developer. Thank You!!!!!
